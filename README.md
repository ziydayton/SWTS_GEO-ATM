# GEO Mapping the 2019 ATM
GOE mapping the 2019 Army Ten Mile run.

## Background

As a continued relationship building event, my wife and I enjoy training for a run every year.  We started with 5k runs and this year we decided to embark on a 10-mile run.  These activities motivate us to perform physical activity while motivating each other.  As part of Coursera's Developing Data Products course, I have decided to plot this years run, the Army Ten-Miler (ATM). (<https://www.armytenmiler.com/>)

The event data from Garmin was download from my personal account through <https://connect.garmin.com>.  The personal activity data comes in 3 format; .tcx, .gpx, and .kml.  The .tcx data was used for mapping this activity.
